                    You've just watched the video and you're probably wondering 'what exactly did I watch?' (If you
                    haven't watched the video yet, what are you waiting for?). The visual embodiment of LowGear
                    Specials' essence, that's what you have just seen.
                    <br /><br />
                    Okay, okay but how can you sum up LowGear Specials in one sentence?
                    <br /><br />
                    Low Gear Special represents a fascinating journey, through one of a kind areas to which you will
                    reach using GPS coordinates given in the roadbook.
                    <br /><br />
                    If you want an even shorter description: Overlanding on a budget.
                    <br /><br />
                    Got your attention? Then, let's continue the discussion.
                    <br /><br />
                    LowGear Specials is an overlanding event where you have to navigate to GPS coordinates provided in
                    the roadbook. Usually these coordinates take you to what feels like the end of the world (offroad),
                    where a beautiful panorama awaits you. At these designated points, you'll arrive with a car
                    purchased for no more than €1000 (exceptions in Q&A), which we encourage you to visually customize
                    to your heart's
                    content. You are probably thinking now "With €1000 you can't afford to get an offroad car!", but we
                    firmly believe that you don't need a 4x4. We are convinced that you can overcome any obstacle if you
                    are determined enough OR if you have enough people to push the car.
                    <br /><br />
                    The most significant aspect of the event is undoubtedly the people you'll share this adventure with.
                    Over the course of a week, you'll experience beautiful and funny moments together, as well as, most
                    likely, some challenging ones. If by the end of the rally you haven't pushed the car at least once,
                    it means that we, the organisers, have done something wrong.

                    The route is designed as an adventurous journey, leading you to various GPS coordinates where the
                    end goal may either be the route itself or the final location you reach. One thing remains certain:
                    you'll always encounter surprises along the way.
                    <br /><br />
                    LowGear Specials is divided into 7 events, one for each day. Every event is planned to be finished
                    in a single day at a moderate pace, giving you plenty of time to take in and enjoy your surroundings
                    (or fix your car). Each event will feature a unique attraction, ranging from off-road adventures and
                    stunning landscapes to historical landmarks, and even abandoned sites. At the end of each day, you
                    will be responsible for finding your own place to sleep. Depending on your budget, you will have 3
                    options: camping in public space (where permitted), camping, or Airbnb/Booking.

                    The LowGear Moldova Special is scheduled from August 10th to 17th, beginning in Brasov County,
                    Romania, and concluding in the Rezina District, Republic of Moldova. The exact GPS coordinates for
                    the adventure will be shared with participants one week prior to the start, digitally, within the
                    event guide. However, we know you can't wait until then so we will reveal some details beforehand:
                    <br /><br />
                    &#8250; You will cross the Carpathian Mountains 4 times;<br />
                    &#8250; Your journey will take you through two countries;<br />
                    &#8250; You'll cover over 2000 kilometers and spend 40 hours driving;<br />
                    &#8250; More than 20% of your time will be spent navigating unpaved roads
                    <br /><br />
                    * Depending on the geopolitical situation in the region, the route may change.

                    This event wants to prove that you don't need a special or expensive car to reach exceptional
                    places. The car's purchase price must not exceed €1000. We believe that you can only really enjoy a
                    car when you don't care if you damage it a bit. Given the likelihood that the car's resale value
                    won't be a concern, we encourage you to customize the vehicle as you desire, within the bounds of
                    applicable laws. In addition to buying and customizing the car, we advise you to invest money in
                    preventive maintenance. In other words, address as many potential issues as you can before the start
                    to avoid losing time at the service during the event.

                    It depends. If you have a car which is close to the 1000€ budget, it is ok. If you have a car which
                    is worth over 3 times the recommended budget, it depends again. If you are planning to drive like
                    there is no tomorrow through mud and potholes & you will modify the car in the spirit of the event,
                    yes we will welcome you. But just remember this, you can find Dacia parts in every village but you
                    cannot find an oil pan for a VW Golf 7.

                    LowGear Special is <b>NOT</b> a competitive event. There are no rankings based on speed or time; the
                    purpose of the event is to enjoy the adventure with your friends.

                <div class="text">
                    Budgets can vary depending on your choice of car, accommodation, and dining preferences. Here's a
                    breakdown for a low-budget estimation:<br />
                    &#8250; Petrol for 2000 km at an average consumption of 8l/100km: approximately 250€;<br />
                    &#8250; Accommodation (outdoors or in the car): around 0€;<br />
                    &#8250; Food expenses per person for 7 days: approximately 100€;<br />
                    &#8250; Early bird registration fee: 150€;<br />
                    &#8250; If you're a team of 4, the cost per person is around 200€.

                <div class="text">
                    It's an unfortunate situation, but it's part of the adventure! You may find yourself facing it
                    alone, but we're sure you'll encounter locals or other crews willing to lend a hand.

                    No need. I mean, yes, it would be helpful in some areas but then it would be too easy 🙂
                    If it's easy, it's no longer an adventure, right?
