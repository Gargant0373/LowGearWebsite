# LowGearSpecial

LowGearSpecial is a car event where each individual must purchase a <1000EUR car and drive with it for 2000km off-road. The project is written in pure HTML, CSS and JS because I felt like it'd help my experience and portfolio to work with an ancient tech stack.

The website is deployed on GitHub Pages and can be viewed [here](https://gargant0373.github.io/LowGearWebsite/).
